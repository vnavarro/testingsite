Then came 2nd gen which was my attempt to create a visually improved site with all my projects as portfolio, it was a Jekyll solution hosted direclty at Github, neat. 3rd gen was the change I needed for better posting, managing the site was giving me headaches thus I tried Ghost. When translation became impossible with Ghost came my decision to migrate to Gatsby, which is the site you see right now. Make yourself confortable while I load back all my old posts, my portfolio, while adding new content.",
